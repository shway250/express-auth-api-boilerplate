# **Basics Auth and API Boilerplate**
I put together a node app with a basic auth strategy that send data from a form to an API. I use PostgreSQL and Sequelize here, but you should be able to use whatever ORM you're comfortable with to spin up a data base and access the data. I also used EJS as a view engine, but you should be able to attach any front end tech you want (Angular, React). I tried to leave comments that would be useful to you.
